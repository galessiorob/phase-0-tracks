# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
*A system that enables you to keep track of changes to files in an orderly manner. It is useful because you can keep a log of every change and addition, and if needed revert to a previous version should the code break.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* A branch is a “movable pointer”, which basically means that each branch is a master pointing at a particular commit that can then be developed into more commits and be merged back when needed to add the changes (features) developed from this pointer.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* A commit is a “change record”, it’s a command that enables your changes to be recorded after you’ve added (staged) them, and records this action with a unique ID, the author and the time stamp so to build a log of the changes and keep track of how the program evolves. A good commit message is a very condensed summer of what you have done up to this point in imperative form.
* What is a merge conflict?
* It occurs when trying to merge branches that have diverged, or in other words, have disagreeing changes so git doesn’t know how to properly digest the changes and you have to help Git decide what to do.
