-Wait for the elevator to flash an upward pointing arrow or an "up" sign
  -If the light flash comes from the down arrow or sign, don't get in
-Once the doors open let people out first and get in
-Press the button of the floor you want to go to:
  -If you re going out, press "lobby", "L" or "1"
  -If you want to go to your appartment, press 6 regardless of the initital floor you where at
-If the door takes more than 15 seconds to close push the "close" button
-As long as the elevator stops and opens the door while flashing signs that are not the same as the floor or lobby you want to go, remain on the elevator
-If/When the elevator flashes the light corresponding to the floor you dialed, wait for the doors to open and exit
